# Predicting-Customer-Churn-Identifying-Customers-that-are-Susceptible-to-Churn
# Project Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast customer churn within the telecommunications industry. Specifically, the project aims to leverage historical customer data and relevant features to create a machine learning model capable of identifying customers who are likely to churn. The model's performance will be assessed using appropriate evaluation metrics. It includes data collection, Exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, evaluation and documentation.
# Business Problem

Intense competition from the many competitors in the market.
Changing customer Preferences usually because of their need for personalized and high-quality services.
Pricing pressures from competitors has affected profitability making competitive pricing very difficult to sustain.
Network quality and performance issues that influence customer satisfaction, which leads to dissatisfaction and churning.
Difficulty in building  and maintaining customer loyalty.
# Why Churn Prediction
Churn prediction is a strategy that uses customer data to identify clients who are least likely to renew their contracts. The significance of initiating this project lies in its potential to address the aforementioned challenges and enhance Reder Telecom's operations. Here are the top reasons that underline the importance of this project:

**Cost Reduction:** Acquiring new customers is more expensive than retaining existing ones. Reducing churn can lead to substantial cost savings.
**Revenue Growth:** A reduction in churn can result in increased revenue as existing customers stay longer and potentially buy additional services.
**Customer Satisfaction:** Understanding customer behavior and preferences enables Reder Telecom to improve its services, leading to higher customer satisfaction and loyalty.

**Competitive Advantage:** By leveraging data analytics to predict churn, Reder Telecom can proactively retain customers and gain a competitive advantage over rivals.

**Data-Driven Decision-Making**: In an industry where data is abundant, using analytics to drive decisions can lead to more informed and effective strategies.
